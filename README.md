# Aruco_Marker_Distance_Pose_Estimation
<p># I worked with aruco marker for my project of autonomous warehouse management system using image processing and vision system </p>

<p># where we used marker for identification purpose and utilized its capablity for realtime distance measurment and pose estimation of AMR's</p>

<p># in this repo i have added how to use aruco markers for the pose estimation as well as distance estimation </p>
